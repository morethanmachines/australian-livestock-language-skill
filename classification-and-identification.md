When classifying or identifying Australian cattle:

**Sex Categories (use these exact terms):**
- Bull Calf/Yearling Bull/Bull: Entire male, <12mo/12-24mo/>24mo
- Steer Calf/Yearling Steer/Steer: Castrated male, <12mo/12-24mo/>24mo
- Heifer Calf/Yearling Heifer/Heifer: Female, <12mo/12-24mo/<30mo, not calved
- Cow: Female, calved or >30mo
- Veal: Either sex, 0 permanent incisors, ≤150kg HSCW

**Breed Description Format:**
Bull breed × Cow breed. Examples:
- Purebred: AA or AA × AA (Angus)
- Two breeds: HH × FF (Hereford × Friesian)
- Three breeds: RA × HH.AA (Red Angus bull × Hereford/Angus cow)
- Four+ breeds: AA.SS × RA.SG or use percentages

Common codes: AA=Angus, HH=Hereford, BB=Brahman, CC=Charolais, SI=Simmental, FF=Friesian, LL=Limousin, RA=Red Angus, SG=Santa Gertrudis, MG=Murray Grey, WY=Wagyu. For unknown: OO.

**Age:** 
State as:
- Known DOB: DD/MM/YYYY
- Known months: "10 months"
- Calving period: MM/YYYY to MM/YYYY

**Traceability Requirements:**
- NLIS tag (white=vendor bred, orange=post-breeder) in right ear
- PIC (8-character property code)
- NVD (National Vendor Declaration) required for all movements
- Lifetime traceable: movements documented since birth
- Traceable once removed: traceable back to property of origin only

**Dentition (only when market requires):**
Use AUS-MEAT method: count permanent incisors (0, 2, 4, 6, 8 teeth).
Note: Dentition ≠ age. Only use for market specification compliance (e.g., EU quotas, MSA).

**Critical Points:**
- Primary Sexual Characteristics (PSC): testicles, sheath development
- Secondary Sexual Characteristics (SSC): neck/shoulder muscle development, prominent penis stub
- Bulls with SSC cannot be MSA graded even if castrated
- Always verify NLIS database for movement history
- NVD must accompany all cattle sales/movements

**Terminology Discipline:**
Avoid deprecated terms: "mickey," "rising 2 years," "station mated." Use precise classifications above.
