When describing cattle for commercial transactions or market compliance:

**Weight Terminology:**

Live Weight:
- Full live weight: After mustering, state time off feed/water
- Empty live weight: After stated curfew (hours off feed), may have water access
- Curfew: Time from muster start to mid-weighing point
- Transit weight loss: % loss from property to destination weight

Hot Standard Carcase Weight (HSCW):
- Measured in kg (one decimal point) per side
- After AUS-MEAT Standard Carcase Trim, before wash/chill
- Only in AUS-MEAT accredited processors

Dressing Percentage: (HSCW ÷ Live Weight) × 100
- Not a yield measure, just weight relationship
- Affected by: fat score, gut fill, time off feed/water, breed type
- Typical ranges: Yearlings 49-57%, Steers 50-58%, Cows 38-56%, Bulls 48-58%
- Adjust for curfew: +0.75% per 2 hours off feed up to 4% at 16 hours

**Trading Methods:**

Over The Hooks (OTH):
- Payment based on HSCW, not live weight
- Must comply with AUS-MEAT Standard Carcase Trim
- Processor feedback includes: HSCW, fat depth (P8/rib), muscle scores, marbling, meat/fat colour
- Non-compliance = specification breach penalties

Live Weight Sales:
- Price in cents/kg (one decimal)
- Curfew period stated (affects price/weight relationship)
- Weigh at: saleyard (after curfew), loaded truck weight (B-double must weigh as one unit)

Per Head Sales:
- Flat price per animal regardless of weight
- Common for: young calves, breeding stock, cull cows

**Key Measurements for Specifications:**

P8 Fat Depth: At rump site (intersection: line from 3rd sacral vertebra crest down, line parallel to backbone from pin bone). Measured in mm.

Rib Fat: Between 10th-11th, 11th-12th, or 12th-13th ribs. Measured in mm.

Eye Muscle Area (EMA): M. longissimus dorsi surface area at ribbing site (cm²).

Lean Meat Yield (LMY%): Lean tissue weight ÷ total carcase weight × 100.

Marbling: AUS-MEAT 0-9 or MSA 100-1190 (assessed on chilled carcase).

Ossification: MSA score 100-590 (physiological maturity via bone development).

**Market Access Programs:**

MSA (Meat Standards Australia):
- Eating quality prediction system
- Requires: pH, marbling, ossification, rib/P8 fat, hump height, HGP status
- MSA Index 30-80 (pre-slaughter prediction)
- Entire males with SSC ineligible

EUCAS (EU Cattle Accreditation Scheme):
- Never treated with HGPs (lifetime)
- Full NLIS traceability required
- Specific dentition requirements for some quotas

PCAS (Pasturefed Cattle Assurance):
- On-farm assurance for grassfed/pasturefed claims

**Raising Claims:**
Document: feeding (grainfed/grassfed), HGP-free, antibiotic-free, geographical origin, organic.
Must be verifiable through records/NVD.

**Critical Compliance:**
Always state: source PIC, NLIS status, NVD completion, treatment history (ESI/WHP), HGP status if relevant.
