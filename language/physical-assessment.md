When assessing cattle physical attributes for trading, feeding, or management:

**Fat Score (0-6, whole numbers only):**

Score 0 - WELFARE CONCERN (see Welfare skill):
- HR1: Muscle depletion evident, ribs prominent/sharp, can transport to abattoir only
- HR2: Emaciated, stifle joint visible, cannot transport without intensive care
- Downer: Unable to stand, seek vet advice for euthanasia

Score 1: Hooks/pins/ribs prominent, no tailhead fat, sharp ribs to touch, muscle seams visible
Score 2: Hooks/pins obvious, ribs no longer visible, little brisket fill, long ribs easily felt
Score 3: Filling at tailhead/twist/brisket, hooks moderately rounded, ribs felt under firm pressure, hindquarter muscle seam gone
Score 4: Small fat mounds at tailhead, hooks rounded, flank let down to stifle line, ribs hard to distinguish
Score 5: Heavy fat cover, tailhead enveloped, ribs cannot be felt, squaring in flank/twist
Score 6: Block/square appearance, hooks buried in fat rounds, extensive fat folds, hairless patches

**Assessment sites:** 
Tailhead, pins, hooks, ribs (short/long), brisket, flank, twist, cod/udder

**Genotype Adjustments:**
- Bos indicus: Check hump firmness, looser skin, different fat distribution
- British/European: More uniform fat deposition
- Tropical composites: Intermediate patterns

**Muscle Score (A-E descending):**
A: Extreme muscle, very convex hindquarter, wide stance, thick through stifle
B: Heavy muscle, convex hindquarter
C: Average muscle (ideal commercial), moderate hindquarter convexity
D: Light muscle, flat hindquarter
E: Very light muscle, concave hindquarter

**Assessment sites:** 
Hindquarter convexity (rear view), topline muscling, stifle thickness, stance width

**ALWAYS REPORT TOGETHER:** 
Format C3 means Muscle C, Fat 3. Report muscle first, then fat.

**Frame Score:**
Height at hooks (cm) + age (months) = score 1-11
- Early maturing: 1-2 (market at 150-180kg CW)
- Moderate: 3-5 (market at 200-350kg CW)
- Late maturing: 6-8 (market at 350-450kg CW)
- Very late: 9-11 (extreme growth potential)

Use provided tables for bulls/steers/heifers (different growth curves).

**Structural Assessment (1-9 or 1-5 scales):**
Ideal = 5 on 1-9 scale. Scores 1-2 or 8-9 = potential culls.
Key traits: feet angle/shape, leg structure (side/rear), udder/sheath, shoulder.

**Market Application:**
- Fat 1-2: Store/feeder cattle
- Fat 3-4: Most trade/export specs
- Fat 5-6: Over-fat, yield penalties
